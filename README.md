TikTok analytics for my meal-prep account for 2022.

I have been an active part of the meal-prep community on TikTok for about a year and this year I want to keep track of my analytics. I have a few different datasets that I am storing data in. One setback here is that some of the data I am storing is dynamic and I have not yet figured out how to update this data automatically.

In the dataset of my overall main account, important variables I am tracking include: date, video views, profile views, likes, comments, shares, followers, follower difference from previous day, a boolean of whether I posted a video or not, and the day of the week.

main account data: https://github.com/arianajschindler/oatmealmonsters_tiktok_2022/blob/28ee213b5328e1ea567eaf4b24a29b3de656d6ee/data/tiktok_data_2022.csv

In the dataset specifically for video data, important variables I am tracking include: date, hour within which the video was posted, category, duration, average watch time in second, percent of viewers who watched full video, plays, likes, comments, shares, and then boolean variables to indicate whether a voiceover was used, if there was in-video text, and if captions were added.

video-specific data: https://github.com/arianajschindler/oatmealmonsters_tiktok_2022/blob/c8bc3a1c354586729aa0c3a532815656791a744d/data/video_specific_data.csv

Additional information I have that remains relatively static is main territories my viewers are from.

Dashboard as of 03/14/2022 has been uploaded.
